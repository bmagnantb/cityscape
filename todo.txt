GalleryView loading screen renders after transition, causing flash of unchanged content before Loading... renders
	- add property to GalleryStore to allow component to know if it should call action to change GalleryStore's isLoading before transition

TESTING

initial render of user info -- currently client receives html with login/register before getting user and rerendering

finish isomorphizing
	- catch hand typed url changes if app is initialized, prevent new page request to server and continue as SPA but make sure to allow refreshes

add user-initiated cache refresh or cache expiration
