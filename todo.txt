GalleryView loading screen renders after transition jump, flash of unchanged content before Loading... renders
	- add property to GalleryStore to allow component to know if it should call action to change GalleryStore's isLoading

GalleryView rendering several times on initial load

TESTING

initial render of user info -- currently client receives html with login/register before getting user and rerendering

finish isomorphizing
	- catch hand typed url changes if app is initialized, prevent new page request to server and continue as SPA
